This script will allow you to generate one time password codes for services like Google.

You will need to install the one time password library with the following command:

**pip install pyotp**

There are currently 2 files that you can run:
**basic.py**: This file will generate a new code in the command prompt window, updating every 30 seconds.
**visual.py**: This file will show a UI box using tkinter, for those of us like something a little more polished.

You can see how this works here: [YouTube Link]
